## Chapter 1
### №1
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 

吾年少气盛易伤之时，家严予以些许忠告，迄今念念不忘。

<br/>

"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, " he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had." 

曰：“欲责人，勿忘己之优渥，非众皆有。”

<br/>

He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved say, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. 

其虽未多言，然心照不宣而神会，吾知其言简而意深。

<br/>

In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. 

鉴于此，三缄其口，不妄下论断。或有皎洁之人赤诚相待，亦致老谋之徒泛泛而叨。遇后者，苦不堪言。

<br/>

（呜呜呜明天要早起……先……就这样！明天补足！QAQ）

### №2

The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. 

若常人显此性，异人易察之而纠缠。吾尝为同砚妄告以“政客”，盖与闻放浪无名者之秘辛罢。

>privy to 秘密参与，了解

<br/>

Most of the confidences were unsought---frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon---for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. 而多非吾所求。每当……？？？，吾以假寐、心不在焉、轻佻？？？……不管了我先去睡觉了QAQ 太肝了这玩意儿

>unsought 未追求的
>
>feign 佯装
>
>preoccupation 盘算，思虑，心事重重
>
>hostile 怀有敌意的
>
>levity 轻浮，轻率
>
>intimate 亲密的，密切的
>
>revelation 披露，揭露
>
>quiver 颤抖
>
>plagiaristic 抄袭的
>
>mar 毁坏，损害
>
>suppression 压制，抑制，镇压

<br/>

Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. 

惜言，毋意，莫方人，是为圣。

<br/>

I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies if parceled out unequally at birth. 

虽继家尊所诫，承其傲，仍惧遗之：人之初，性本异，天道不公，是以为偏。

>snobbishly 势利的，自命不凡的
>
>decency 体面，正派，得体，彬彬有礼，行为准则
>
>parcel 包，裹好，打包

<br/>

**At any rate** Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she **nodded at me almost imperceptibly** and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and **given her something of** a fright.

不管怎样，贝克小姐的嘴唇微微一动，她几乎看不出来地向我点了点头，接着赶忙把头又仰回去——她在保持平衡的那件东西显然歪了一下，让她吃了一惊。

I **looked back at** my cousin who began to ask me questions **in her low, thrilling voice**.

我掉过头去看我的表妹，她开始用她那低低的、令人激动的声音向我提问题。

<br/>

**It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down** as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.

这是那种叫人侧耳倾听的声音，仿佛每句话都是永远不会重新演奏的一组音符。

<br/>

Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth—but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: **a singing compulsion**, a **whispered** “Listen, ” a promise that she had done gay, **exciting things just a while since** and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.

她的脸庞忧郁而美丽，脸上有明媚的神采，有两只明媚的眼睛，有一张明媚而热情的嘴，但是她声音甲有一种激动人心的特质，那是为她倾倒过的男人都觉得难以忘怀的：一种抑扬动听的魅力，一声喃喃的“听着”，一种暗示，说她片刻以前刚刚干完一些赏心乐事，而且下一个小时里还有赏心乐事。

> gay 同性恋的；【旧】艳丽的；【旧】快乐的；【非正式的】品质差的，没有意义的

<br/>

I told her how I had **stopped off in Chicago for a day** on my way east and how a dozen people had **sent their love through me**.

“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all night along the North Shore.”

<br/>

“I'd like to.”

“我很想看。”

“She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her? ”
